## Why Are FIDIC Claims Important?

Managing claims under FIDIC contracts is crucial for protecting the contractor’s rights when scope changes arise. Delays, extra work or changing conditions can negatively impact the project’s time and cost if not managed properly. Understanding how to prepare and handle claims is therefore a cornerstone of project success.

### Steps for Preparing a Claim

1. **Define the Event:** Clearly state the date, scope and impacts of the event giving rise to the claim.
2. **Review Contract Clauses:** Identify the relevant clauses in the FIDIC Yellow Book 1999 or other applicable form that underpin the claim.
3. **Collect Evidence:** Gather all supporting documents such as updated schedules, correspondence and site records.
4. **Time & Cost Analysis:** Assess the impact of the event on project duration and budget; tools like Primavera P6 and TILOS can help.
5. **Compile the File:** Prepare a report that narrates the event, references the contract clauses and states the requested time or cost adjustments.

### Conclusion

Proper claim management helps resolve project disruptions and prevents disputes between parties. A well‑prepared claim file protects the contractor’s rights and facilitates the owner’s assessment of the request.
